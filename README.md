# Standardized Testing, Statistical Summaries and Inference

This is my first data science related lab. In this project I will take a look at aggregate SAT and ACT scores and participation rates from each state in the United States, will try to identify trends in the data and combine our data analysis with outside research to identify likely factors influencing participation rates and scores in various states.

### Learning Objectives

To familiarize myself with:

- basic statistics (distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing)

- many Python programming concepts

- programmatically interacting with files and directories

- visualizations with Matplotlib and Altair

- EDA

- working with Jupyter notebooks for development and reporting

### Datasets

For this project, I will be using 2017 SAT and 2017 ACT score dataset. These data give average SAT and ACT scores by state, as well as participation rates, for the graduating class of 2017. See the data folder to get access to the dataset. 

You can see the source for the SAT data [here](https://blog.collegevine.com/here-are-the-average-sat-scores-by-state/), and the source for the ACT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows).
